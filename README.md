# GS Nuker

This is a powerful tool that allows you to take control of your Discord server and show who the real show-off is. It's made with Python and the requests library, and boasts a clean and user-friendly interface.

One of the standout features of this tool is its modular design, making it easy to add new modules and customize it to your liking. The current modules include Delete all channels and Create channels, but there's plenty of room for expansion and creativity.

Another great feature of this tool is that it automatically handles proxies to ensure that you won't get API banned while using it. This is especially helpful for users who are new to requests and may be more prone to making mistakes.
